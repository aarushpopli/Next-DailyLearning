The camera movement gives a cinematic feel to the animation. I have other ideas also about the animation and I will execute them tomorrow.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><span>Today I played only rapid games (10+0) and was able to play well from both black and white. The first five moves in every game were all book moves according to the engine. I am quite happy about the games I played today.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><span>Today I completed my Bootstrap tutorial with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/CodeWithHarry\/videos\" target=\"_blank\">CodeWithHarry<\/a> and made a complete Blog Website using most of the components of bootstrap. It was a great experience learning from this channel. Now my next step is to learn Angular from the same channel.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><span>I watched the second episode of <a href=\"https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLLbfvOX935JFYAHk4u4i9zI1oOyUNcbli\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Insurance<\/a> and today I learned about life insurance. Now I know why life insurance is important, when is the best time to take it, and how to compare different insurance packages. The most important takeaway was to always take a terms plan because with a small amount one can get a very large cover.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><\/div>",
