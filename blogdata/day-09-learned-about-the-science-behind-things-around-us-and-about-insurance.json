I learned it from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/smartereveryday\/videos\" target=\"_blank\">Smarter Every Day<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/veritasium\/videos\" target=\"_blank\">Veritasium<\/a>on YouTube. I learned the science behind getting a tattoo and removing a tattoo. I learned about how a whip breaks the sound barrier, how trees bend the laws of physics, what is butterfly dust, and many more things like this. It was fun to learn about the things around us.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><span>I watched the sixth episode of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLLbfvOX935JFYAHk4u4i9zI1oOyUNcbli\" target=\"_blank\">The Complete Guide to Buying Insurance<\/a> and learned about other types of insurance like travel insurance, burglary insurance, job-loss insurance, insurance plans for business owners, and home insurance. It was the last episode of the series and I learned a lot about insurance in this journey and I am confident that I will make an informed decision whenever I will buy insurance.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><\/div>",
