    "content": "<div><ul><li><span>I learned about the use of audio in animations and added audio to my animations with the help of a freemium software called <a href=\"https:\/\/getsoundly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Soundly<\/a>. It has many sound clips for example rain sound, wooden objects falling sound, and many more. We can slow down the audio to match the type of animations we have. Also, I edited a video in blender today.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><span>In chess, I read articles about the Scandinavian Defense which is 1. e4 d5. It seems odd at the start but it has an advanced logic to it. But essentially the idea is to reach a pawn structure that looks like this, after say 1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nc3 Qa5 4.Nf3 Bg4 5.Be2 c6 6. O-O e6. This pawn structure, known as the Caro structure, is known as one of the most solid structures in chess. So by playing the Scandinavian, Black can achieve this structure while keeping a very open position.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><span>In Bootstrap I learned about navbars, carousel, buttons, and dropdowns. It was easy to implement as the base code is given in the <a href=\"https:\/\/getbootstrap.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">documentation<\/a>. I also learned about how colors are defined in Bootstrap.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;<\/span>Primary means sky blue color.<\/span><br><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;<\/span>Secondary means grey color.<\/span><br><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.&nbsp;<\/span>Success means green color.<\/span><br><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.&nbsp;<\/span>Danger means red color.<\/span><br><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; 5.&nbsp;<\/span>Warning means mustard yellow color.<\/span><br><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; 6.&nbsp;<\/span>Info means teal color.<\/span><br><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; 7.&nbsp;<\/span>Light means white color.<\/span><br><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; 8.&nbsp;<\/span>Dark means black color.<\/span><br><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; 9.&nbsp;<\/span>Link means transparent.<\/span><\/span><\/p><\/div>",
