It consists of cubes stacked on one another and a ball falling. These are also called rigid body simulations. Currently, it has no sound but, I will learn about it in the coming days.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><span>I also learned about a chess opening today. I started playing chess in lockdown and saw some basic chess openings from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/ChessBaseIndiachannel\/videos\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Chessbase India<\/span><\/a> channel on YouTube. Last week, there was a league tournament, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vvqCraxN4BQ&amp;ab_channel=SamayRaina\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Chess Super League<\/span><\/a>, where many Indian players and some international players participated. I got motivated by seeing it and tried to learn the theory in chess. So I learned about the King's Pawn opening. It is the opening that I usually play but never got into the theory. The first move played is e4 by white and famous chess player Bobby Fischer said that e4 is \"best by test\". There are many variations in it. One can go 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 which is a standard opening. Other possibilities can be 1. e4 c5 which is called a Sicilian Defense. The only way to improve at chess is to learn daily and today was my first day and I hope the learning continues.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><\/div>",
