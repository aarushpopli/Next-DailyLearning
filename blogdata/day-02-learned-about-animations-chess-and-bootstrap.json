Also, I made the camera move with the object. It was done by making the camera the child of the object to be followed. I also saw some more YouTube videos on rigid body simulations and have many animation ideas which I will execute in the coming days.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><span>In chess, I read articles on 1.e4 opening and got to know that there are many different variations which this opening. Like the French Defense 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5. White has a few ways to handle the French, such as the Advance Variation (3.e5) and Exchange Variation (3.exd5). It is quite overwhelming for me and I tried playing some games, but it was hard for me to remember all this. But I will not stop learning about this complicated game.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><span>I also started learning about Bootstrap from the YouTube channel <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/CodeWithHarry\/videos\" target=\"_blank\">CodeWithHarry<\/a> and completed the introduction today. Bootstrap is quite easy to learn and the main reason is that the documentation provided is easy to navigate and read. I also learned about the various feature of VSCode software one of them is that the editor automatically formats the code and it makes it readable and looks clean.<\/span><\/li><\/ul><\/div>",
